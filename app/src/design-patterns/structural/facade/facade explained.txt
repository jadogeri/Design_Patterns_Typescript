The Facade design pattern simplifies the interface to a complex subsystem by providing a unified, higher-level interface. It acts as a wrapper, hiding the complexities of the underlying classes and making the system easier to use for clients. 
Example in Java with Interfaces: 
Consider a multimedia system with components like AudioPlayer, VideoPlayer, and SubtitleManager. 
// Subsystem interfaces
interface AudioPlayer {
    void playAudio(String fileName);
    void stopAudio();
}

interface VideoPlayer {
    void playVideo(String fileName);
    void stopVideo();
}

interface SubtitleManager {
    void loadSubtitles(String fileName);
    void displaySubtitles();
}

// Concrete implementations of subsystem components
class MP3Player implements AudioPlayer {
    @Override
    public void playAudio(String fileName) {
        System.out.println("Playing MP3: " + fileName);
    }
    @Override
    public void stopAudio() {
        System.out.println("Stopping MP3 playback.");
    }
}

class MP4Player implements VideoPlayer {
    @Override
    public void playVideo(String fileName) {
        System.out.println("Playing MP4: " + fileName);
    }
    @Override
    public void stopVideo() {
        System.out.println("Stopping MP4 playback.");
    }
}

class SRTManager implements SubtitleManager {
    @Override
    public void loadSubtitles(String fileName) {
        System.out.println("Loading SRT subtitles: " + fileName);
    }
    @Override
    public void displaySubtitles() {
        System.out.println("Displaying subtitles.");
    }
}

// Facade class
class MultimediaFacade {
    private AudioPlayer audioPlayer;
    private VideoPlayer videoPlayer;
    private SubtitleManager subtitleManager;

    public MultimediaFacade() {
        this.audioPlayer = new MP3Player();
        this.videoPlayer = new MP4Player();
        this.subtitleManager = new SRTManager();
    }

    public void playMovie(String videoFile, String audioFile, String subtitleFile) {
        System.out.println("Starting movie playback...");
        videoPlayer.playVideo(videoFile);
        audioPlayer.playAudio(audioFile);
        subtitleManager.loadSubtitles(subtitleFile);
        subtitleManager.displaySubtitles();
    }

    public void stopMovie() {
        System.out.println("Stopping movie playback...");
        videoPlayer.stopVideo();
        audioPlayer.stopAudio();
    }
}

// Client usage
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MultimediaFacade facade = new MultimediaFacade();
        facade.playMovie("movie.mp4", "soundtrack.mp3", "subtitles.srt");
        facade.stopMovie();
    }
}

SOLID Principles and Facade: 

• Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): The Facade's primary responsibility is to provide a simplified interface to a subsystem, not to implement the subsystem's logic itself. Each subsystem component adheres to SRP. 
• Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The Facade can be extended (e.g., by adding new methods for new functionalities) without modifying its existing interface or the client code. 
• Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): While the Facade provides a unified interface, the underlying subsystem components can still have specific interfaces that clients needing fine-grained control can interact with directly. 
• Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The Facade depends on abstractions (interfaces like AudioPlayer), not concrete implementations, allowing for flexibility and easier changes to the underlying components.
